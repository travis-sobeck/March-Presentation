Background on how it all got started .... Powerapps/flow vs LA
Starting with Google Form. Then discuss alternatives.
Overall flow.  Google Form > Google Script > Azure Webhook/Runbook > Flow (or Logic Apps) > back to Azure Webhook/Runbook
Note, flow is part of Office 365, need enterprise license

Google:
> Discuss alternatives
> Start with Form
> Sheet backend
> Script (GoogleForm.js) > create trigger > on form Submit > Notify on failure > agree to stuff

Azure:
> Resource Group
> Automation Account
> Runbook
> Webhook (RB MUST be published) - create new, add to google and azure variable and powershell file
> Call Flow/Logic App (-ContentType 'application/json' very importantping )
> compare google sheet headers to input

Flow/Logic App:
> Discuss difference, Note, flow is part of Office 365, need enterprise license
> show 
> rerturn to Azure
=======


Powershell:
> Rerun job or kick off new Rb or flow
